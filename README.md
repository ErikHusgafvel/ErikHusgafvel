### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”¥ You just landed on the best GitHub profile ever - warmly welcome! ðŸ”¥

I've been working on learning Full Stack Development skills and that's what this profile and its repositories are all about

My learning is tightly tied to [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/about) course, courtesy of University of Helsinki. During the course, I've had hands-on experience of building modern single-page apps using React, Node.js, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, TypeScript, Redux, and MongoDB. The most notable repositories are listed below ðŸš€

1) [Blog-app backend](https://github.com/ErikHusgafvel/osa4_blogilista). With Blog-app backend, client can create user profile(s), ask all user profiles, login to a profile, create blog posts, delete posts, increase likes for a post, ask information about all and/or a specific post. This app uses client-side session management and some actions are restricted to a logged profile. Utilized technologies: MongoDB, Express, jsonwebtoken, bcrypt, lodash, express-async-errors, cors. During development, I've also utilized eslint, nodemon, jest, supertest

2) [Blog-app frontend](https://github.com/ErikHusgafvel/HY-MOOC-Full-stack-development/tree/master/osa5/bloglist-frontend). The Blog-app frontend displays blogs in the client-side, handles login and logout actions, let's a user create new blogs, give a like for a blog and remove own blogs. Successful actions (such as removal of own blog) is notified for the client with a simple Notification-component. Utilized technologies: react and axios. During development, I've also utilized eslint and cypress. This app uses client-side session management.

### 3. [Redux frontend app](https://github.com/ErikHusgafvel/HY-MOOC-Full-stack-development/tree/master/osa6/redux-anecdotes)
Simple front-end service for creating, updating and displaying anecdotes. The focus is on the front-end storage, which is built with Redux reducers instead of React's states. Specifically, the app uses Provider (react-redux store), configureStore (@reduxjs/toolkit) and createSlice (@reduxjs/toolkit)
- Key-words: react, react-redux, redux-thunk, reduxjs, axios, jest

### 4. [Full stack Blog-app](https://github.com/ErikHusgafvel/HY-MOOC-Full-stack-development/tree/master/osa7/blogapp)
Front- and backend solutions for an app that allows users to create and remove own Blog-instances, and comment and like own and others' Blog-instances. Some of the actions require users to be logged in, some actions are restricted to the owner of the Blog-instance. Application relies on client-side session management.
   - Front-end key-words: react, react-redux, react-router, axios, cypress, eslint, prettier, lodash, material-ui
   - Back-end key-words: node.js, express, mongodb, mongoose, jsonwebtoken, bcrypt, nodemon, eslint, jest, supertest

### 5. [GraphQL Full stack Books and Authors -app](https://github.com/ErikHusgafvel/HY-MOOC-Full-stack-development/tree/master/osa8/kirjat-ja-kirjailijat)
Front- and backend solutions with emphasis on utilizing GraphQL. With the app, user can examine authors and books saved in the database, login, and add books to store. Application relies on client-side session management.
   - Back-end key-words: node.js, graphql, apollo server, mongodb, mongoose, jsonwebtoken, nodemon
   - Front-end key-words: graphql, react, apollo client, eslint

### 6. [Typescript Full stack Patientor-app](https://github.com/ErikHusgafvel/HY-MOOC-Full-stack-development/tree/master/osa9/patientor)
   Front- and backend solutions for creating and displaying patient information. The app lists patients and by clicking the name, one can examine patient information in more detail. One can also create new patients through a form. The emphasis has been in learning typescript both in front- and backend. Types, interfaces, interface extensions and enums are used both in front- and backend. Backend utilizes type narrowing for proofing input data.
   - Front-end key-words: typescript, react, vite, react-router, axios, eslint, material-ui
   - Back-end key-words: typescript, ts-node-dev, express, eslint, uuid

### 7.  [PostgreSQL backend for Blog-app](https://github.com/ErikHusgafvel/osa13_blogisovelluksen_backend_psql)
   Postgres database with Fly.io and Sequelize. The app utilizes server-side session management (leveraging express-session and connect-session-sequelize libraries). Changes to the database have been introduced through migrations. The app handles errors quite extensively and uses express-async-errors under the hood. The app supports
   - Key-words: postgres, sequelize, express, bcrypt, express-session, connect-session-sequelize, cross-env, umzug, uuid, nodemon
