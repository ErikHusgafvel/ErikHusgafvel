### Hi there 👋

🔥 You just landed on the best GitHub profile ever - warmly welcome! 🔥

I've been lately working on learning Full Stack Development skills and that's what this profile and its repositories are all about

My learning of FSD is tightly tied to the course [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/about) offered by the University of Helsinki. During the course, I've had hands-on experience of building modern single-page apps using React, Node.js, GraphQL, Redux, MongoDB, PostgreSQL and TypeScript. To make it as easy as possible to find the relevant projects from the repositories, I will explain everything right here 🚀

1) [Blog-app backend](https://github.com/ErikHusgafvel/osa4_blogilista) with MongoDB, Express, jsonwebtoken, bcrypt, lodash, express-async-errors. During development, I've acquainted myself with nodemon, jest, supertest
