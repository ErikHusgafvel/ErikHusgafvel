### Hi there 👋

🔥 You just landed on the best GitHub profile ever - warmly welcome! 🔥

I've been lately working on learning Full Stack Development skills and that's what this profile and its repositories are all about

My learning of FSD is tightly tied to the course [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/about) offered by the University of Helsinki. During the course, I've had hands-on experience of building modern single-page apps using React, Node.js, GraphQL, Redux, MongoDB, PostgreSQL and TypeScript. To make it as easy as possible to find the relevant projects from the repositories, I will explain everything right here 🚀

1) [Blog-app backend](https://github.com/ErikHusgafvel/osa4_blogilista). With Blog-app backend, client can create user profile(s), ask all user profiles, login to a profile, create blog posts, delete posts, increase likes for a post, ask information about all and/or a specific post. This app uses client-side session management and some actions are restricted to a logged profile. Utilized technologies: MongoDB, Express, jsonwebtoken, bcrypt, lodash, express-async-errors, cors. During development, I've also utilized eslint, nodemon, jest, supertest

2) [Blog-app frontend](https://github.com/ErikHusgafvel/HY-MOOC-Full-stack-development/tree/master/osa5/bloglist-frontend). The Blog-app frontend displays blogs in the client-side, handles login and logout actions, let's a user create new blogs, give a like for a blog and remove own blogs. Successful actions (such as removal of own blog) is notified for the client with a simple Notification-component. Utilized technologies: react and axios. During development, I've also utilized eslint and cypress. This app uses client-side session management.

3) [Redux Anecdotes](https://github.com/ErikHusgafvel/HY-MOOC-Full-stack-development/tree/master/osa6/redux-anecdotes). Simple front-end service for creating, updating and displaying anecdotes. The focus is on the front-end storage, which is built with Redux reducers instead of React's states. Specifically, the app uses Provider (react-redux store), configureStore (@reduxjs/toolkit) and createSlice (@reduxjs/toolkit)
