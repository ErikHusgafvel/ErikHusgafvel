## Hi there üëã

You just landed on the best GitHub profile ever - warmly welcome! üî•

I've been working on learning Full Stack Development and that's what this profile and its repositories are all about üöÄ

My learning journey is closely tied to the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/about) course, courtesy of the University of Helsinki. Throughout the course, I've gained hands-on experience on building modern single-page apps using React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, TypeScript, GraphQL, Redux, and MongoDB. The most notable repositories are listed below 

### ü•á [PostgreSQL backend for Blog-app](https://github.com/ErikHusgafvel/osa13_blogisovelluksen_backend_psql) ü•á
   Postgres database with Fly.io and Sequelize. The app utilizes server-side session management (leveraging express-session and connect-session-sequelize libraries). Changes to the database have been introduced through migrations. The app handles errors quite extensively and uses express-async-errors under the hood.
   - Key-words: PostgreSQL, Sequelize, Express, Bcrypt, Express-Session, Connect-Session-Sequelize, Cross-Env, Umzug, Uuid, Nodemon

### ü§ñ [Typescript Full stack Patientor-app](https://github.com/ErikHusgafvel/HY-MOOC-Full-stack-development/tree/master/osa9/patientor) ü§ñ
   Front- and backend solutions for creating and displaying patient information. The app lists patients, and by clicking the name, one can examine patient information in more detail. One can also create new patients through a form. The emphasis has been in learning Typescript both in front- and backend. Types, interfaces, interface extensions and enums are used both in front- and backend. The backend utilizes type narrowing for proofing input data.
   - Front-end key-words: Typescript, React, Vite, React-Router, Axios, ESLint, Material-UI
   - Back-end key-words: Typescript, Ts-Node-Dev, Express, ESLint, Uuid

### :octocat: [GraphQL Full stack Books and Authors -app](https://github.com/ErikHusgafvel/HY-MOOC-Full-stack-development/tree/master/osa8/kirjat-ja-kirjailijat) :octocat:
Front- and backend solutions with emphasis on utilizing GraphQL. With the app, user can examine authors and books saved in the database, login, and add books to store. The application relies on client-side session management.
   - Back-end key-words: Node.js, GraphQL, Apollo Server, MongoDB, Mongoose, Jsonwebtoken, Nodemon
   - Front-end key-words: GraphQL, React, Apollo Client, ESLint

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è [Full stack Blog-app](https://github.com/ErikHusgafvel/HY-MOOC-Full-stack-development/tree/master/osa7/blogapp) ‚ú≥Ô∏è
Front- and backend solutions for an app that allows users to create and remove own Blog-instances, and comment and like own and others' Blog-instances. Some actions require users to be logged in, and some actions are restricted to the owner of the Blog-instance. The application relies on client-side session management.
   - Front-end key-words: React, React-Redux, React-Router, Axios, Cypress, ESLint, Prettier, Lodash, Material-UI
   - Back-end key-words: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Jsonwebtoken, Bcrypt, Nodemon, ESLint, Jest, Supertest

### üß† [Redux frontend app](https://github.com/ErikHusgafvel/HY-MOOC-Full-stack-development/tree/master/osa6/redux-anecdotes) üß†
Simple front-end service for creating, updating and displaying anecdotes. The focus is on the front-end storage, which is built with Redux reducers instead of React's states. Specifically, the app uses Provider (React-Redux store), configureStore (@reduxjs/toolkit) and createSlice (@reduxjs/toolkit)
- Key-words: React, React-Redux, Redux-Thunk, Reduxjs, Axios, Jest
