### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### You just landed on the best GitHub profile ever - warmly welcome!

#### I've been lately working on learning Full Stack Development skills and that's what this profile and its repositories are all about. My learning of FSD is tightly tied to the course [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/about) offered by the University of Helsinki. Most of the exercises are under [this](https://github.com/ErikHusgafvel/HY-MOOC-Full-stack-development) repository, but some of the exercises are in separate repositories due to course practicalities. Don't worry, I will open up everything right here!
